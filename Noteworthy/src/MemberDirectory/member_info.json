Car singing is way more fun than shower singing because in the car, I really let loose. So I was reaching the climax of a favorite Broadway showstopper, belting with all my heart, when I glanced out my right window. There was a car driving alongside me, and inside was a woman staring at me with an expression that said, “Does he think the car is soundproof?” We locked eyes, sharing the moment when I realized that she was watching me not realize that she heard me. We both looked away quickly. It was awkward for both of us.\n\nThere has to be a moral to this story somehow. Maybe it’s that singing should be emotive without inhibition. Sing for yourself and sing from the heart. Or maybe the moral is that you should never make eye contact with people because if they’re already looking at you it’ll be twice as awkward as not making eye contact. Yeah, I think that’s the moral."

STOP. STOP THINKING THAT. You look hot and sexy. If your friend asked you if they looked good in that same photo, of course you would say they look amazing. So why do you not do the same thing to yourself?? “Treat others the way you want to be treated” my ass. Try reversing that. Give yourself the same respect that you give other people. BE COCKY. It’s hot and shows confidence to other people. Hooray!\n\nDon’t feel pressured to ever wake up super early in the morning and start your day. Some people can get up at like 5 and finish their day early. It doesn’t work that way for everybody! Everybody’s biological clock is built differently, and we each have different optimal sleep cycles. So if you’re trying your best to start the day at 5 but can never seem to wake up energized, it’s probably not because you’re “unproductive” or “lazy”. You just genuinely aren’t made to do it. If you’re more awake and energized during the later hours of the day, OWN IT. Good for you! Good job!"
